Abstract
========

This GLEP provides both a minimum requirement and a recommended set of
OpenPGP key management policies for the Gentoo Linux distribution.

Changes
=======

v2
  The distinct minimal and recommended expirations have been replaced
  by a single requirement. The rules have been simplified to use
  the same maximum time of 900 days for both the primary key and subkeys.

  An additional rule requesting key renewal 2 weeks before expiration
  has been added. This is in order to give services and other developers time
  to refresh the key.

  The usage of DSA keys has been disallowed.

  The ``gpgfingerprint`` LDAP field has been altered to remove optional
  whitespace.

  The ``gpg.conf`` contents have been removed as they were seriously
  outdated and decreased security over the modern defaults.

  The requirement of SHA-2 digest has been extended to apply to self-
  signatures made on subkeys.

v1.1
  The recommended RSA key size has been changed from 4096 bits
  to 2048 bits to match the GnuPG recommendations [#GNUPG-FAQ-11-4]_.
  The larger recommendation was unjustified and resulted in people
  unnecessarily replacing their RSA-2048 keys.

  Minimal specification has been amended to allow for ECC keys.

  The option of using DSA subkey has been removed from recommendations.
  The section now specifies a single recommendation of using RSA.

Motivation
==========

Given the increasing use and importance of cryptographic protocols in internet
transactions of any kind, unified requirements for OpenPGP keys used in Gentoo
Linux development are sorely needed.  This document provides both a set of
bare minimum requirements and a set of best practice recommendations for
the use of GnuPG (or other OpenPGP providers) by Gentoo Linux developers.
It is intended to provide a basis for future improvements such as, e.g.,
consistent ebuild or package signing and verifying by end users.

Specifications for OpenPGP keys
===============================

Bare minimum requirements
-------------------------
This section specifies obligatory requirements for all OpenPGP keys used
to commit to Gentoo. Keys that do not conform to those requirements can
not be used to commit.

1. SHA-2 series output digest (SHA-1 digests internally permitted),
   at least 256-bit.  All subkey self-signatures must use this digest.

2. Signing subkey that is different from the primary key, and does not
   have any other capabilities enabled.

3. Primary key and the signing subkey are both of type EITHER:

   a. RSA, >=2048 bits (OpenPGP v4 key format or later only),

   b. ECC curve 25519.

4. Expiration date on key and all subkeys set to no more than 900 days
   into the future.

5. Key expiration date renewed at least 2 weeks before the previous
   expiration date.

6. Upload your key to the SKS keyserver rotation before usage!

Recommendations
---------------
This section specifies the best practices for Gentoo developers.
The developers should follow those practices unless there is a strong
technical reason not to (e.g. hardware limitations, necessity of replacing
their primary key).

1. Primary key and the signing subkey are both of type RSA, 2048 bits
   (OpenPGP v4 key format or later).

2. Key expiration renewed annually to a fixed day of the year.

3. Create a revocation certificate & store it hardcopy offsite securely
   (it's about ~300 bytes).

4. Encrypted backup of your secret keys.

Gentoo LDAP
===========

All Gentoo developers must list the complete fingerprint for their primary
keys in the "``gpgfingerprint``" LDAP field. It must be exactly 40 hex digits,
uppercase, without whitespace.

The prior "``gpgkey``" field will be removed, as it is a subset
of the fingerprint field. In any place that presently displays
the "``gpgkey``" field, the last 16 hex digits of the fingerprint should
be displayed instead.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There is no consistent standard for GPG usage in Gentoo to date. There is
conflicting information in the Devmanual [#DEVMANUAL-MANIFEST]_ and the GnuPG
Gentoo user guide [#GNUPG-USER]_. As there is little enforcement of Manifest
signing and very little commit signing to date, there are no backwards
compatibility concerns.

External documentation
======================

Much of the above was driven by the following:

* NIST SP 800-57 recommendations [#NISTSP800571]_, [#NISTSP800572]_,

* Debian GPG documentation [#DEBIANGPG]_,

* RiseUp.net OpenPGP best practices [#RISEUP]_,

* ENISA Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters Report 2013 [#ENISA2013]_.
